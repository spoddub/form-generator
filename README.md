# Form Generator

Form Generator is a small Ruby library for building HTML forms in application templates with a simple, declarative DSL. It addresses a common need and can be used on its own or alongside existing view code. The design emphasizes a clear separation between form structure and rendering, predictable output suitable for testing, and straightforward integration. The project draws inspiration from established solutions such as Rails form helpers and the Simple Form gem while remaining lightweight and well-suited for learning and test-driven development.
